# Quant Developers

Developers in the Quant team prioritize **security** of projects designed with a **secure foundation** and **efficient implementation**, **flexible access methods** to individual source artifacts from the outside, and **free operation**.

Quant basically does not try to deeply evaluate your development skills. Of course, we **assume that you know the basic concepts**. What is important is the mindset of thinking about safety and anonymity, and the passion and motivation for pure development, because if you possess these strengths, you can create a path to run together with just that. Or are you already a Quant developer? Then don't be frustrated or lament about your skills.

If you are a Quant developer, you can basically perform efficient development through various methods and steps that will be introduced from now on. Of course, this knowledge is not only available to Quant developers. Quant prioritizes security and freedom.
