# Garden (Coming Soon)

Quant is <Highlight>preparing a Quant pipeline application called `Garden` to allow individual team members to more flexibly perform tasks such as freely publishing their projects and requesting feedback or modifications from other team members.</Highlight> This application will only be available to Quant team members immediately after release, but it may be changed to public later. Basically, it is closed so that it cannot be accessed from the outside, so gentle measures are possible when mistakes are made, and it will also be used mainly in the development of post-quantum encryption communication lines.

`Garden` is still in the planning stage, so it seems it will take quite some time from production to team member deployment and public release, but <Highlight>it will be developed in an instant once large-scale projects such as [EntanglementLib](/docs/projects/entanglementlib/) or [Blue-Bridge](/docs/projects/blue-bridge/) are completed.</Highlight> That's because EntanglementLib took less than two months from the start of one-person development to the first release on GitHub.
