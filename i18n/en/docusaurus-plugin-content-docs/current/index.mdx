# Team Quant

The Quant team can be described as the guardians of an absolute security system that makes any external intrusion physically impossible, based on the exclusivity and uncertainty of quantum mechanics.

We aim not just to build simple firewalls, but <Highlight>to protect users' data and infrastructure by wrapping them in the laws of physics themselves, the most powerful laws in the universe</Highlight>. While problems that would take tens of thousands of years to solve with classical computing methods might become powerless before the massive drill known as a quantum computer, in the <Highlight>quantum security network environment built by Quant, even the torque of that drill is absorbed as part of the security</Highlight>.

Quant ensures that <Highlight>users' entire information systems are perfectly shielded from external observation</Highlight>. We research, design, and provide intelligent defense mechanisms where data conceals its own form the moment someone touches it with malicious intent. To secure 100% safety without tolerating even a 1% gap, our team controls quantum states day and night, pouring <Highlight>passion bordering on obsession into building a robust, ultra-trusted infrastructure that makes attackers feel despair</Highlight>. We are confident that with Quant, your workspace will become the only sanctuary maintaining tranquility amidst any technological storm.

# This Documentation

Quant Composite Docs is a space that comprehensively summarizes various projects developed by Quant, the application of quantum mechanics to security, and the fundamental knowledge (concepts) required for such processes.

We are doing our best to organize all concepts regarding quantum information science and provide the necessary tools.
